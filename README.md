# 🔍 Strategy Logic Framework

The setup consists of 3 structural phases:

1. Impulse Leg
2. Pullback
3. Continuation Breakout (Entry)

---

# 1️⃣ Trend Qualification Rules

## Indicator

**20 EMA**

### Uptrend Criteria

- Price above EMA
- EMA sloping upward
- Higher highs present
- No impulse close below EMA

### Downtrend Criteria

Opposite conditions.

---

## EMA Slope Threshold

Minimum slope requirement:

```
EMA(now) − EMA(10 candles ago) ≥ 1.5 pips
```

Flat EMA → No trade.

---

# 2️⃣ Impulse Leg Detection

Impulse confirms institutional activity.

### Requirements

- Minimum 5 candles
- Directional closes
- Large bodies
- Minimal overlap
- Range expansion

### Quantified Rules

```
Impulse size ≥ 8 pips
Body dominance ≥ 60%
Overlap ≤ 30%
```

Weak impulse → Ignore setup.

---

# 3️⃣ Pullback Qualification

Pullback represents liquidity refill.

## Candle Count

```
Minimum: 2
Maximum: 5
```

> More than 5 = weakening trend

---

## Pullback Depth

Measured against impulse range:

```
Valid: 30% – 50%
Maximum: 60%
```

Beyond 60% → Setup invalid.

---

## EMA Interaction

Pullback must:

- Touch EMA  
OR
- Stay within 1.5 pips of EMA

Deep penetration invalidates trade.

---

## Candle Behavior

Healthy pullbacks show:

- Smaller bodies
- Momentum slowdown
- Wick presence
- Candle overlap

Automation proxy:

```
Pullback avg body < 70% of impulse avg
```

---

# 4️⃣ Structure Integrity Rule

Trend structure must remain intact.

### Buy Setup Invalid If

- Lower low forms
- Impulse origin breaks
- Close below EMA − 1 pip buffer

### Sell Setup

Opposite conditions.

---

# 5️⃣ Entry Trigger Rules

Continuation confirmation required.

## Buy Entry

```
Break of pullback high + 0.3 pip buffer
```

## Sell Entry

```
Break of pullback low + 0.3 pip buffer
```

---

## Entry Modes

| Mode | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Tick Break | Automation |
| Candle Close | Manual |
| Tick + Delay | Hybrid |

---

# 6️⃣ Spread Filter

Scalping viability depends on spread control.

| Spread | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ≤ 0.8 pip | Trade allowed |
| 0.8 – 1.0 | Caution |
| > 1.0 | Block trades |

---

# 7️⃣ Stop Loss Model

## Structural SL (Primary)

Buy:

```
Below pullback low − 0.5 pip
```

Sell:

```
Above pullback high + 0.5 pip
```

---

## Fixed SL Fallback

```
6 – 7 pips
```

Used when structural stop < 4 pips.

---

# 8️⃣ Take Profit Model

## Standard TP

```
10 pips
```

## Adaptive TP (Recommended)

Options:

- 1 : 1.2 RR
- Liquidity highs/lows
- Impulse projection

Automation Default:

```
RR = 1 : 1.2
```

---

# 9️⃣ Trade Management Rules

## Break‑Even

Move SL to BE at:

```
+5 pips
```

---

## Partial Scaling (Optional)

- Close 70% at TP1
- Trail 30% via EMA

---

## Time Stop

Exit if:

```
No TP hit within 15 candles
```

---

# 🔟 Volatility Filter

Minimum activity requirement:

```
Avg candle range ≥ 0.6 pip
```

Low volatility → Skip trades.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ News Filter

```
15 min before red news
15 min after red news
```
